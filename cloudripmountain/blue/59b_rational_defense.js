/*Use fortification intelligently or read the list carefully.
Ogres are going to attack from the front and the back.
Protect the peasants.
Build defensive structures in the right order to protect the peasants from the forest attack.
You've learnt how to use str.split(separator)  method in previous levels.
Don't forget that this method returns an array of strings.
If you have problems with this level, then try previous levels and return after refreshing your skills.*/
